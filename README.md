# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my project! 
In this readme file i described what i used to build this project and what helped me.

## Responsive web design

In the project i used CSS flexbox  and @media query in order to make the site responsive.

It will change it's size and change it's properties according to the browser size.

## Styles and script

In this project i created 2 CSS stylesheets and 1 script file.

1. styles.css - containing most style code
2. font.css - containing custom font 
3. script.js - containing scripts for the page

In javascript i created a script that verifies entered email using regex and also changes the window to the success one.

### Useful sites

While doing this project i used few sites to get little help:

- https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp   -- helped to make elements change size when the browser width is smaller
- https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp   -- helped to make the site look like it should
- https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-shadow.php   -- helped to give a final touch to one of the elements
- https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp  -- helped me make email error message go back to normal after few seconds
- https://regex101.com/  -- helped make regex for email validation
